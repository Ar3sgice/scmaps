# scmaps
A repository of Starcraft maps I made in the past. Includes maps I made from scratch and maps I edited a version.
My entire map collection: https://github.com/Ar3sgice/starcraft-maps

## def
Defense maps. Kind of my favorite category so I made a lot of these

## eud_remaster
EUD maps suitable for Starcraft Remastered. Most of them are converted from my old EUD maps, while some are new, like Click2Kill 2020.
