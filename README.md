# scmaps
A repository of Starcraft maps I made in the past. Includes maps I made from scratch and maps I edited a version.
My entire map collection: https://github.com/Ar3sgice/starcraft-maps

## def
Defense maps. Kind of my favorite category so I made a lot of these

## bound
Bound maps. You control a unit (most likely zergling) to run through the map avoiding explosions and dark archons

## arena
PvP/competitive maps. I have no idea how to play Desert Strike correctly

## troll
Maps that seem normal but goes wrong after a certain point in the game

## eud_remaster
EUD maps suitable for Starcraft Remastered. Kind of a pity the game doesn't support iscript editing otherwise I can convert things like ASD3 or 7vs1probe to the new version
