# scmaps
A repository of Starcraft maps I made in the past. Includes maps I made from scratch and maps I edited a version.
My entire map collection: https://github.com/Ar3sgice/starcraft-maps

### def
Defense maps. Kind of my favorite category so I made a lot of these

### bound
Bound maps. You control a unit (most likely zergling) to run through the map avoiding explosions and dark archons

### team
Teamwork maps. either requires no micro or too many micro

### rpg
RPG maps. Players only have one unit but it's overpowered enough to wipe out the entire map

### arena
PvP/competitive maps. Including Blood/Madness type maps

### troll
Maps that seem normal but goes wrong after a certain point in the game

### eud_remaster
EUD maps suitable for Starcraft Remastered. Kind of a pity it doesn't support iscript editing, it would be pretty fun
